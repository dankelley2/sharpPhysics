## Physics Algorithms

### Broad-Phase Collision Detection
The engine uses **spatial hashing** for efficient broad-phase collision detection. This algorithm divides the world into a grid of cells and assigns objects to cells based on their position. Only objects in the same or adjacent cells are checked for collisions.

### Narrow-Phase Collision Detection
For narrow-phase collision detection, the engine uses different algorithms depending on the shapes involved:

1. **Circle vs Circle**: Simple distance check between centers
2. **Polygon vs Circle**: Find closest point on polygon to circle center
3. **Polygon vs Polygon**: Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)

### Collision Resolution
The engine uses **impulse-based collision resolution**. When a collision is detected, impulses are applied to the objects to resolve the collision. The impulse magnitude depends on the objects' masses, velocities, and restitution (bounciness).

### Object Sleep States
To optimize performance, objects that have been stationary for a while are put to sleep. Sleeping objects don't participate in physics calculations until they're woken up by a collision or user interaction.

## Creating Your Own Game

Implement the `IGame` interface and register it with the `GameEngine`:

```csharp
public class MyGame : IGame
{
    public void Initialize(GameEngine engine) { /* Setup your game */ }
    public void Update(float deltaTime, KeyState keyState) { /* Game logic */ }
    public void Render(Renderer renderer) { /* Custom rendering */ }
    public void Shutdown() { /* Cleanup */ }
}
```

> 📖 **For detailed API reference, common patterns, and troubleshooting tips, see the [Game Development Guide](SharpPhysics.Demo/README.md).**

## Dependencies

### Core Physics Engine (SharpPhysics.Engine)
- [SFML.Net](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml.net/) - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for .NET (rendering, windowing, input)

### Pose Detection (PoseIntegrator.Vision)
The pose detection library uses machine learning for real-time body tracking:

- **Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime** - Cross-platform ONNX model inference runtime
- **Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML** (Windows only) - GPU acceleration via DirectML for faster inference on Windows
- **OpenCvSharp4** - OpenCV wrapper for image processing, video capture, and frame manipulation
- **OpenCvSharp4.runtime.*** - Platform-specific native binaries (win/osx/linux)

> **Note:** The platform-specific packages are conditionally included based on the build target OS, allowing the same codebase to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
